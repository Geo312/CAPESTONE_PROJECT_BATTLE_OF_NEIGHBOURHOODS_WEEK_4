    "Toronto is said to be the largest city of Canada. Many immigrant cultures have come to Toronto and have brought their traditions, languages, food, and music to the city. This shows that Toronto is the most ethnically diverse city. Besides, the diverse culture that is brought into the city, Toronto is also a business-minded, conscientious, socially progressive, and pluralistic city. It is a city of many museums, theatres, festival events and sports activities. \n",

    "Thus,the purpose of this project is to provide enough information for someone who would like to open up a bakery in the city of Toronto. The idea is to help someone make a smart and efficient decision on selecting a great location for starting a bakery in Toronto. Fast forward in time, this will help the owner of the bakery to feel he/she made the right decision and hopefully have the bakery bringing in more customers year on year, and simultanseously growing the business over time.   \n",
    "\n",
    "So as part of this project, we will list and visualise all major parts of Toronto City that has great bakeries spread across the city."
